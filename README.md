## EpUp Study Data Release

# EpLink, Ontario Brain Institute

# Overview

About one third of people with epilepsy experience comorbid depression. UPLIFT (Using Practice and Learning to Increase Favorable Thoughts) uses mindfulness-based cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) principles to treat depression in people with epilepsy. The EpUp study aimed to examine outcomes of UPLIFT versus EpINFO, an epilepsy information and self-management program. The effects of these distance-delivery, group intervention programs were studied in adults with epilepsy and self-reported depressive symptoms. 

# Data organization and file format

Data is organized based on clinical form, participant cohort (UPLIFT and EpINFO), and timepoint.  88 packages are available that include data for 66 participants across 14 clinical forms, and 6 timepoints.  Data is available in CSV format with accompanying README's and data dictionaries.
